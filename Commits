def generate_username(name, color, animal):
    # Extracting first letter of each input
    initials = name[0].lower() + color[0].lower() + animal[0].lower()
# I started with this in order to start the process or randomizing your username and password using information that you will give in your input. 

# Generating a random number between 1000 and 9999
    rand_num = random.randint(1000, 9999)
    
    # Combining initials and random number to create username
    username = initials + str(rand_num)
# I used these commands in order to further randomize the username and password by adding numbers and combing it with the first part. 

# Taking inputs
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")
    animal = input("Enter your favorite animal: ")
# these will be the inputs for the project that generate the username and password.

# Printing username and password
    print("Generated username:", username)
    print("Generated password:", password)
This command will tell the user their user name and password as an output after all the inputs.
